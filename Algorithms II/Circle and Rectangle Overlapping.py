You are given a circle represented as (radius, xCenter, yCenter) and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.

Return true if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return false. In other words, check if there is any point (xi, yi) that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.

 

Example 1:


Input: radius = 1, xCenter = 0, yCenter = 0, x1 = 1, y1 = -1, x2 = 3, y2 = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Circle and rectangle share the point (1,0).
Example 2:

Input: radius = 1, xCenter = 1, yCenter = 1, x1 = 1, y1 = -3, x2 = 2, y2 = -1
Output: false
Example 3:


Input: radius = 1, xCenter = 0, yCenter = 0, x1 = -1, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, y2 = 1
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= radius <= 2000
-104 <= xCenter, yCenter <= 104
-104 <= x1 < x2 <= 104
-104 <= y1 < y2 <= 104




class Solution:
    def checkOverlap(self, radius: int, xCenter: int, yCenter: int, x1: int, y1: int, x2: int, y2: int) -> bool:
        # Find the closest point in the rectangle to the center of the circle
        xClosest = max(x1, min(xCenter, x2))
        yClosest = max(y1, min(yCenter, y2))

        # Calculate the distance between the center of the circle and the closest point
        distanceSquared = (xClosest - xCenter)**2 + (yClosest - yCenter)**2

        # If the distance is less than or equal to the radius squared, the circle and rectangle overlap
        return distanceSquared <= radius**2
