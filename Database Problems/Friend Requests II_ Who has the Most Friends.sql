Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.



# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT id, num
FROM (
    SELECT id, COUNT(*) as num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id as id FROM RequestAccepted
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id as id FROM RequestAccepted
    ) AS Friends
    GROUP BY id
) AS Counts
WHERE num = (
    SELECT MAX(num)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(*) as num
        FROM (
