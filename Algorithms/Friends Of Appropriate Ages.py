There are n persons on a social media website. You are given an integer array ages where ages[i] is the age of the ith person.

A Person x will not send a friend request to a person y (x != y) if any of the following conditions is true:

age[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7
age[y] > age[x]
age[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100
Otherwise, x will send a friend request to y.

Note that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.

Return the total number of friend requests made.

 

Example 1:

Input: ages = [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
Example 2:

Input: ages = [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
Example 3:

Input: ages = [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 3
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
 

Constraints:

n == ages.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
1 <= ages[i] <= 120





class Solution:
    def numFriendRequests(self, ages: List[int]) -> int:
        count = [0] * 121
        for age in ages:
            count[age] += 1

        prefix_sums = [0]
        for i in range(1, 121):
            prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + count[i])

        res = 0
        for age in range(15, 121):
            if count[age] == 0:
                continue
            count_in_range = prefix_sums[age] - prefix_sums[age // 2 + 7]
            # People of this age send friend request to count_in_range - 1 people, as we do not send request to ourselves
            res += count[age] * (count_in_range - 1)
        return res
