Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 increasing subsequences of length 1, so output 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2000
-106 <= nums[i] <= 106



class Solution:
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0

        n = len(nums)
        lengths = [0] * n  # lengths[i] = longest ending in nums[i]
        counts = [1] * n  # count[i] = number of longest ending in nums[i]

        for j, num in enumerate(nums):
            for i in range(j):
                if nums[i] < nums[j]:
                    if lengths[i] >= lengths[j]:
                        lengths[j] = 1 + lengths[i]
                        counts[j] = counts[i]
                    elif lengths[i] + 1 == lengths[j]:
                        counts[j] += counts[i]

        longest = max(lengths)
        return sum(c for i, c in enumerate(counts) if lengths[i] == longest)
