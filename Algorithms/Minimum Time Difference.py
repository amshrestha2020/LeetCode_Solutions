Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.
 

Example 1:

Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 104
timePoints[i] is in the format "HH:MM".




from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        def convert(time):
            return int(time[:2]) * 60 + int(time[3:])
        
        minutes = sorted(map(convert, timePoints))
        minutes.append(minutes[0] + 1440)

        return min(b - a for a, b in zip(minutes, minutes[1:]))
