Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [2]
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= n
 

Follow up: Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.




class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # For each number i in nums, we mark the number that i points as negative.
        # Then we filter the list, get all the indexes who points to a positive number
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            index = abs(nums[i]) - 1
            nums[index] = - abs(nums[index])

        return [i + 1 for i, num in enumerate(nums) if num > 0]
