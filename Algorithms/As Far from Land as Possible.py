Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1





from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        q = deque([(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if grid[i][j] == 1])
        if len(q) == 0 or len(q) == n * n:
            return -1

        level = -1
        while q:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                x, y = q.popleft()
                for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                        grid[nx][ny] = 1
                        q.append((nx, ny))
            level += 1

        return level
