Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 104
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.




from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagrams = defaultdict(list)
        for word in strs:
            # Use sorted word as a key in the dictionary
            sorted_word = "".join(sorted(word))
            anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)
        return list(anagrams.values())
