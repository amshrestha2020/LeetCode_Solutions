Given an unsorted integer array nums. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in nums.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1






class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Move each positive number to its corresponding index (e.g., 1 goes to index 0, 2 goes to index 1, etc.)
        for i in range(n):
            while 0 < nums[i] <= n and nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]:
                nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]
        
        # Iterate through the array to find the first missing positive integer
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] != i + 1:
                return i + 1
        
        # If all positive integers from 1 to n are present, return n + 1
        return n + 1
