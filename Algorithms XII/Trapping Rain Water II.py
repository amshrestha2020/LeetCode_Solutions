Given an m x n integer matrix heightMap representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.

 

Example 1:


Input: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.
We have two small ponds 1 and 3 units trapped.
The total volume of water trapped is 4.
Example 2:


Input: heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]
Output: 10
 

Constraints:

m == heightMap.length
n == heightMap[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 104




import heapq

class Solution:
    def trapRainWater(self, heightMap: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not heightMap or not heightMap[0]:
            return 0

        m, n = len(heightMap), len(heightMap[0])
        heap = []
        visited = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]

        # Push all the block on the border into heap
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == m-1 or j == n-1:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (heightMap[i][j], i, j))
                    visited[i][j] = 1

        result = 0
        while heap:
            height, i, j = heapq.heappop(heap)
            for x, y in ((i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)):
                if 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and not visited[x][y]:
                    result += max(0, height-heightMap[x][y])
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (max(height, heightMap[x][y]), x, y))
                    visited[x][y] = 1
        return result
