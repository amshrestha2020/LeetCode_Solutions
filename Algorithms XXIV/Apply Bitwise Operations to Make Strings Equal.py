You are given two 0-indexed binary strings s and target of the same length n. You can do the following operation on s any number of times:

Choose two different indices i and j where 0 <= i, j < n.
Simultaneously, replace s[i] with (s[i] OR s[j]) and s[j] with (s[i] XOR s[j]).
For example, if s = "0110", you can choose i = 0 and j = 2, then simultaneously replace s[0] with (s[0] OR s[2] = 0 OR 1 = 1), and s[2] with (s[0] XOR s[2] = 0 XOR 1 = 1), so we will have s = "1110".

Return true if you can make the string s equal to target, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1010", target = "0110"
Output: true
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose i = 2 and j = 0. We have now s = "0010".
- Choose i = 2 and j = 1. We have now s = "0110".
Since we can make s equal to target, we return true.
Example 2:

Input: s = "11", target = "00"
Output: false
Explanation: It is not possible to make s equal to target with any number of operations.
 

Constraints:

n == s.length == target.length
2 <= n <= 105
s and target consist of only the digits 0 and 1.




class Solution:
    def makeStringsEqual(self, s: str, target: str) -> bool:
        count_s = s.count('1')
        count_target = target.count('1')

        # If both strings have at least one '1', we can manipulate to match
        if count_s > 0 and count_target > 0:
            return True
        
        # If both strings are entirely '0's, they must be identical
        if count_s == 0 and count_target == 0:
            return s == target
        
        # If one string has '1's and the other does not, it's impossible
        return False
