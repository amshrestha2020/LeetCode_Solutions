Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

Append the character '0' zero times.
Append the character '1' one times.
This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: 
One possible valid good string is "011". 
It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011". 
All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.
Example 2:

Input: low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".
 

Constraints:

1 <= low <= high <= 105
1 <= zero, one <= low
